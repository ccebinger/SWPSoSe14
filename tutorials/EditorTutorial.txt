## Build ##
Install Qt4 or above. See Qt5Tutorial.txt for the Qt5 version.
If you have the QtCreator installed, you can build the project by opening the file
	Editor/TextEditor/TextEditor.pro
and compiling it yourself.
Otherwise start a terminal and go to the directory
	Editor/TextEditor/

To build call
	qmake
	make

This should have created an executable "TextEditor".
